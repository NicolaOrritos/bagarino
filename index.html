<p>"bagarino" <em>sells</em> you tickets and can tell a real ticket from a fake one. Simple, fast and RESTful.
Ask it for a new ticket and it'll give you. Then ask it whether a ticket is still valid or expired. Or whether it is a fake. It'll know for sure.
When tickets expire simply ask bagarino for new ones.</p>

<p>bagarino can be used as a support for a licensing server and as an helper to other systems in an authentication scenario.</p>

<h2>
<a name="install" class="anchor" href="#install"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Install</h2>

<pre><code>npm install -g bagarino
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a name="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h2>

<p><em>bagarino</em> needs Redis (<a href="http://redis.io/">http://redis.io/</a>) to be installed and running in order to work.
To start bagarino run the following command:</p>

<pre><code>sudo bagarino
</code></pre>

<p><em>bagarino</em> is now up and running, listening for requests on port 8124.
Here's a detailed guide on how to submit a request for creating new tickets and/or validating old ones.</p>

<h3>
<a name="new-tickets" class="anchor" href="#new-tickets"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>New tickets</h3>

<p>Obtain a new ticket:</p>

<pre><code>http://localhost:8124/tickets/new?policy=requests_based
200 OK {"result":"OK","ticket":"7fd88ab09e40f99767e17df27a723d05562d573b","expires_in":100,"policy":"requests_based"}
</code></pre>

<p>See the status of the newly created ticket:</p>

<pre><code>http://localhost:8124/tickets/7fd88ab09e40f99767e17df27a723d05562d573b/status
200 OK {"status":"VALID","expires_in":99,"policy":"requests_based"}
</code></pre>

<p>After some requests (99 more in this case) the ticket expires. Then, asking for it again will result in the following response:</p>

<pre><code>200 OK {"status": "EXPIRED"}
</code></pre>

<p>Asking for a non-existent ticket results in the following:</p>

<pre><code>http://localhost:8124/tickets/321somenonsense123/status
404 Not Found {"status":"ERROR","cause":"not_found"}
</code></pre>

<p>By default new tickets have a time-based expire policy and a time-to-live of 60 seconds.
A different policy can be used by specifying the <em>"policy"</em> parameter in query-string:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>policy=time_based</strong> is the default one. Add "seconds=300" to make the ticket expire after the non-default delay of 5 minutes.</li>
<li>
<strong>policy=requests_based</strong> makes the ticket expire after a certain amount of requests of its status you do to bagarino. By default it's 100 requests, but you can otherwise specify e.g. "requests=500" to make it last for 500 requests.</li>
<li>
<strong>policy=cascading</strong> makes the ticket <em>depend</em> on another one: once the <em>dependency</em> ticket expires the <em>dependent</em> one does as well.</li>
<li>
<strong>policy=manual_expiration</strong> makes the ticket perpetual, unless you make it expire manually by calling the <em>"expire"</em> verb (explained some lines below).</li>
<li>
<strong>policy=bandwidth_based</strong> makes the ticket perpetual as well, but the number of requests for it that can be done within a minute is limited.</li>
</ul><p>Let's see some requests that create tickets with different expiration policies:</p>

<pre><code>http://localhost:8124/tickets/new?policy=requests_based&amp;requests=5
200 OK {"result":"OK","ticket":"62a315cd7bdae5e84567cad9620f82b5defd3ef0","expires_in":5,"policy":"requests_based"}

http://localhost:8124/tickets/new?policy=requests_based
200 OK {"result":"OK","ticket":"0b4e20ce63f7de9a4a77910e7f909e5dba4538f3","expires_in":100,"policy":"requests_based"}

http://localhost:8124/tickets/new?policy=time_based&amp;seconds=120
200 OK {"result":"OK","ticket":"50ab14d6f5dd082e8ed343f7adb5f916fa76188a","expires_in":120,"policy":"time_based"}

http://localhost:8124/tickets/new?policy=cascading&amp;depends_on=f073145dfdf45a6e85d0f758f78fd627fa301983
200 OK {"result":"OK","ticket":"9ae23360fb4e9b3348917eb5e9b8a8e725b0dcb0","depends_on":"f073145dfdf45a6e85d0f758f78fd627fa301983","policy":"cascading"}

http://localhost:8124/tickets/new?policy=manual_expiration
200 OK {"result":"OK","ticket":"f57d75c23f6a49951a6e886bbc60de74bc02ef33","policy":"manual_expiration"}
</code></pre>

<p>When using the manual expiration policy you must call an appropriate verb to make the ticket expire:</p>

<pre><code>http://localhost:8124/tickets/f57d75c23f6a49951a6e886bbc60de74bc02ef33/expire
200 OK {"status":"EXPIRED"}
</code></pre>

<p>Subsequent requests for that ticket will give an "EXPIRED" status.</p>

<p>Finally, bandwidth-based tickets can be created with the following requests:</p>

<pre><code>http://localhost:8124/tickets/new?policy=bandwidth_based&amp;reqs_per_minute=100
200 OK {"result": "OK", "ticket": "2966c1fc73a0d78c96bdc18fb67ed99af1356b8a", "requests_per_minute": 100, "policy": "bandwidth_based"}
</code></pre>

<h3>
<a name="valid-tickets" class="anchor" href="#valid-tickets"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Valid tickets</h3>

<p>Asking for a ticket status is all you can do with a newly created ticket. bagarino will answer with three different statuses:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>VALID</strong></li>
<li><strong>EXPIRED</strong></li>
<li><strong>NOT_VALID</strong></li>
</ul><p>The answer will carry some more info when the ticket is still valid:</p>

<pre><code>http://localhost:8124/tickets/0b4e20ce63f7de9a4a77910e7f909e5dba4538f3/status
200 OK {"status":"VALID","expires_in":99,"policy":"requests_based"}
</code></pre>

<p>In the previous example the expiration policy and the TTL (Time-To-Live) of the ticket are returned, as well as its status.
The parameter <em>"expires_in"</em> has to be read based on the policy of the ticket:</p>

<ul>
<li>When the policy is <strong>time_based</strong> then <em>"expires_in"</em> is the number of seconds before the ticket expires</li>
<li>When the policy is <strong>requests_based</strong> the value of <em>"expires_in"</em> is the number of requests before the ticket expires</li>
</ul>

<h3>Expired tickets</h3>

<p>Expired tickets are kept in memory by bagarino for 10 days. After that time a call to their status will return "NOT_VALID" as it would for a ticket that didn't exist in the first place.</p>

<h3>Forceable manual expiration</h3>

<p>Even tickets with a policy other than <em>"manual_expiration"</em> can be forcibly ended by calling the <em>expire</em> verb, provided that they had been created with an ad-hoc option, <em>"can_force_expiration"</em>:</p>

<pre><code>http://localhost:8124/tickets/new?policy=requests_based&amp;can_force_expiration=true
200 OK {"result": "OK", "ticket": "d81d9b01e323510ba919c0f54fbfba5b7903e326", "expires_in": 100, "policy": "requests_based"}
</code></pre>

<p>The result will look identical to any other <em>requests_based</em>-policied ticket but the <em>can_force_expiration</em> option enables the call to the <em>expire</em> verb to successfully end this ticket life:</p>

<pre><code>http://localhost:8124/tickets/d81d9b01e323510ba919c0f54fbfba5b7903e326/expire
200 OK {"status": "EXPIRED"}
</code></pre>

<p>Creating the ticket without this option and subsequently calling <em>expire</em> would have produced the following error:</p>

<pre><code>400 Bad Request {"status": "ERROR", "cause": "different_policy"}
</code></pre>

<h3>Mass-creation of tickets</h3>

<p>It's possible to create more tickets at once by adding the paramenter "count" to the query-string of the verb <em>new</em>, followed by the number of tickets to be created.
The maximum number of tickets that can be created this way is capped to prevent overloading the system.
Here's a typical request for mass-creation of tickets:</p>

<pre><code>http://localhost:8124/tickets/new?count=4
200 OK {"result":"OK","tickets":["9c7800ec9cf053e60674042533710c556fe22949","3cd5da62c2ba6d2b6b8973016264282f61f4afdd","7207c7effb2bd8fd97b885a4f72492a97e79babf","75a6cf2ba0454dfe74a4d6ce8baa80881fb76005"],"expire_in":60,"policy":"time_based"}
</code></pre>

<h3>Tickets contexts</h3>

<p>Sometimes it may be useful to bound one or more tickets to a "context" so they only acquire a meaning under certain conditions.
In bagarino this is done by attaching a textual context to the ticket during the "new" operation:</p>

<pre><code>http://localhost:8124/tickets/new?policy=requests_based&amp;context=mysweetlittlecontext
200 OK {"result":"OK","ticket":"7486f1dcf4fc4d3c4ef257230060aea531d42758","expires_in":100,"policy":"requests_based"}
</code></pre>

<p>Once it's scoped this way requests for that ticket status that don't specify the context won't be able to retrieve it, resulting in a "not_found" error, the same given when asking for a non-existent ticket:</p>

<pre><code>http://localhost:8124/tickets/7486f1dcf4fc4d3c4ef257230060aea531d42758/status
404 Not Found {"status":"ERROR","cause":"not_found"}
</code></pre>

<p>The way to ask for a context-bound token is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>http://localhost:8124/tickets/7486f1dcf4fc4d3c4ef257230060aea531d42758/status?context=mysweetlittlecontext
200 OK {"status":"VALID","expires_in":99,"policy":"requests_based"}
</code></pre>

<h3>Auto-renewing tickets</h3>
<p>A ticket created with the option <em>autorenew=true</em> automatically generates a new one right before expiring.
Only requests-based ones can be decorated at creation with the additional option <em>"autorenew"</em>.
When this option is <em>true</em> bagarino automatically spawns a new ticket when the old one's expiration is one request away,
returning this newly created one alongside the validity/expiration info of a <em>"status"</em> request.
The new ticket's policy and initial TTL will be the same as the old one's.</p>
<p>Here's how an autorenew ticket is created:</p>
<pre><code>http://localhost:8124/tickets/new?policy=requests_based&amp;requests=10&amp;autorenew=true
200 OK {"result":"OK","expires_in":10,"ticket":"0cca33a81e4ce168f218d74692e096c676af2a25","policy":"requests_based"}
</code></pre>
<p>After asking 9 times for this ticket validity here's what happens asking one more time:</p>
<pre><code>http://localhost:8124/tickets/0cca33a81e4ce168f218d74692e096c676af2a25/status
200 OK {"status":"VALID","expires_in":0,"policy":"requests_based","next_ticket":"c7433c48f56bd224de43b232657165842609690b"}
</code></pre>
<p>A new ticket, <em>c7433c48f56bd224de43b232657165842609690b</em>, is born, right when the old one expires and with the same policy and initial TTL.</p>
